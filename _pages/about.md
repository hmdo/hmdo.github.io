Warm Greetings! My name is Ha Manh Do. I am currently a Senior Machine Learning Engineer with Plume Design, Inc.

I earned the B.S. degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam, in 1999. I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Oklahoma State University (OSU), USA, in 2018 and 2015, respectively. My primary areas of research interests include:

Apart from research and academics, I enjoy playing tennis, traveling, and practicing mindfulness. Iâ€™m a keen sport enthusiast and I love swimming as well as watching football. My favorite teams are OSU Cowboys.
