## Hello & Welcome

I’m **Ha Manh Do**, a **Principal Machine Learning Engineer and applied AI researcher** at Righ, Inc. I am passionate about building intelligent systems that bridge machine learning, AI, robotics, and smart-home intelligence to create real-world impact in everyday life.

Over the past decade, I’ve led and contributed to advanced R&D and product engineering across **agentic AI, LLMs, machine learning engineering, robot perception, and smart environments**, delivering innovation from academic labs to commercial scale.

Previously, I served as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Plume Design, where I shipped **edge-AI and cloud-AI solutions powering adaptive Wi-Fi, smart-home intelligence, and motion-sensing systems** deployed worldwide.

Before industry, I conducted research in **circuit design, FPGA systems, mobile robotics, human-robot interaction, and socially assistive robotics** at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Oklahoma State University (OSU), Colorado State University Pueblo, University of Louisville - LARRI Robotics Institute.

I hold a **Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (Robotics Perception)** and an M.S. in Control Systems from OSU, and a B.S. in Electronics & Computer Engineering from HUST.
